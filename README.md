# Library Management System
This is a project I've done for my OOP class, where we were tasked to create a library management system.
The system takes input from users through the console and a text file, and any new books added will be appended on the text file.
We also needed to make use of OOP concepts such as inheritence, polymorphism and abstraction to create the application.
